# CVE-2016-9086 Exploitation Guide

**CVE-2016-9086** is a security vulnerability that was discovered in the **GitLab Community Edition** and **GitLab Enterprise Edition** software. The vulnerability allows an _authenticated attacker_ to disclose arbitrary files on the **GitLab** server. The vulnerability is caused by improper access control in the **GitLab** file browsing functionality. An attacker with a valid GitLab account could craft a malicious **URL** to access and download files outside of the expected file system paths.
The vulnerability affects **GitLab Community Edition** versions `8.13.0` through `8.13.4`, and **GitLab Enterprise Edition** versions `8.13.0` through `8.13.4`. It is considered a high-severity vulnerability with a **CVSS** score of `7.5`.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the **CVE-2016-9086** vulnerability, **GitLab** has released updates that address the issue. Users of affected **GitLab** versions should update to the latest stable release as soon as possible.

In addition to updating **GitLab**, organizations should also consider the following steps to further mitigate the vulnerability:

1. **Restrict file browsing functionality**: Review and restrict the file browsing functionality in **GitLab** to limit the ability to access files outside of the expected file system paths.
2. **Implement defense-in-depth measures**: Enhance the overall security posture of the **GitLab** deployment by implementing additional security controls, such as network segmentation, access controls, and logging and monitoring.
3. **Monitor for signs of compromise**: Closely monitor the **GitLab** deployment for any signs of suspicious activity or potential exploitation attempts, and respond promptly to any detected incidents.
