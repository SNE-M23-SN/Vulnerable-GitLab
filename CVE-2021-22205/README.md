### CVE-2021-22205 Exploitation Guide

**CVE-2021-22205** is a critical security vulnerability discovered in the **GitLab Community Edition** and **GitLab Enterprise Edition** software. This vulnerability allows an **unauthenticated attacker** to execute arbitrary code on the GitLab server. The issue arises from improper validation and sanitization of user-supplied file names in the file upload functionality. This flaw can be exploited to upload malicious files that can execute arbitrary code on the server.

The vulnerability affects **GitLab Community Edition** and **GitLab Enterprise Edition** versions prior to `13.10.3`, `13.9.6`, and `13.8.8`. It has a high-severity CVSS score of `10.0`.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the **CVE-2021-22205** vulnerability, **GitLab** has released patches in the aforementioned versions. Users should update to the latest stable release as soon as possible to address this critical issue.

In addition to updating **GitLab**, organizations should consider the following steps to further mitigate the risk:

1. **Restrict file upload functionality**: Limit the ability to upload files to trusted users and thoroughly validate and sanitize all file names and contents.
2. **Implement security controls**: Enhance the overall security posture of the GitLab deployment by implementing additional security controls such as web application firewalls (WAFs), access controls, and rigorous input validation mechanisms.
3. **Monitor for signs of exploitation**: Actively monitor the GitLab deployment for any signs of suspicious activity or potential exploitation attempts, and respond promptly to any detected incidents.
